**SeSSHion** (formerly **ssh-mcp / ssh-mcp-rs**) is a lightweight SSH MCP server for LLM agents.

Its capability-bound toolset combines deterministic long-running jobs, bounded context, and atomic remote edits. Written in Rust, SeSSHion gives an AI agent secure, narrowly-scoped control of a remote Linux host over a single persistent SSH session through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). It exposes four base tools plus two explicitly privileged sudo variants and is built to keep agent context small and operations deterministic.

## Why

- **Capability-bound surface.** Four base tools and two optional sudo variants, no open-ended remote API. The agent can run commands, patch files, transfer files, and inspect background jobs. Rootless host context arrives automatically in init instructions.
- **Deterministic long-running jobs.** `background=true` returns a `job_id` immediately for commands and transfers; poll it with `check_process` instead of depending on the client RPC deadline.
- **Bounded context.** Foreground shell output is capped by `--max-output-tokens` by default. Use bounded commands when inspecting large remote files.
- **Per-file atomic remote edits.** `apply_patch` edits as the SSH user; the separately gated `sudo_apply_patch` preserves the same conflict detection and atomic commit under sudo. Multi-file calls are not transactions.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `shell` | Run a command via POSIX `sh` as the connected user; `background=true` for long tasks. |
| `sudo_shell` | Same, under `sudo` (uses `--sudo-password`); can be disabled with `--disable-sudo`. |
| `check_process` | Poll a command or transfer background job by `job_id`. |
| `apply_patch` | Create, update, or delete remote UTF-8 files with one exact patch (atomic per file, conflict-checked). |
| `sudo_apply_patch` | Same exact patch flow under `sudo`; can be disabled with `--disable-sudo`. |
| `transfer` | Move files/directories (`put`/`get`); `background=true` returns immediately. `auto` uses `exec-raw` for agent-backed routes; otherwise it safely falls back through `rsync` → `sftp` → `scp` → `exec-raw` before writing. |

Full parameter schemas are served to the client at runtime; deeper references live in [`Docs/`](#documentation).

Inspect remote text with bounded shell commands such as `head -n 800 -- /path`, `tail -n 200 -- /path`, or `sed -n '801,1600p' -- /path`. Use `transfer` with `operation=get` to retrieve files instead of printing large content into the MCP response.

### Rootless startup environment

Before serving MCP, the CLI automatically collects one best-effort remote snapshot
and embeds its compact JSON in `instructions`, delivered by both `initialize` and
`server/discover`. There is no environment tool to call. MCP clients decide how
server instructions are included in the model's context. The 14 fixed fields are:

`hostname`, `os`, `distribution`, `kernel_release`, `machine_architecture`,
`process_architecture`, `pointer_width`, `available_cpu_parallelism`,
`effective_uid`, `effective_gid`, `running_as_root`, `shell_executable`,
`cpu_models`, and `virtualization`.

`cpu_models` is `null` or a sorted sample of at most four unique kernel-reported
model names (trimmed UTF-8, no control characters, at most 256 bytes per name).
The probe reads `/proc/cpuinfo` once using POSIX builtins, considering only the
first 128 lines within a 64 KiB **post-read processing budget**, and emits small
summaries rather than the raw file. A crossing line is discarded. POSIX `read`
consumes a whole line before its size can be checked; this is not a hard remote
allocation/input-byte limit. Only `model name` is used: ARM systems reporting
only CPU implementer/part or board `Hardware` can legitimately return `null`.
This is neither a complete CPU inventory nor verified physical-host identification.

`virtualization` always contains independent `container` and `vm` values:

```json
"virtualization":{"container":"docker","vm":null}
```

Known identifiers mean positive supported evidence; `"unknown"` means positive
but unidentified/conflicting evidence; `null` means not determined, **never**
confirmed absence or bare metal. A named `/run/systemd/container` declaration
takes precedence over markers; generic `oci` can be refined by markers, with
`/run/.containerenv` (Podman) before `/.dockerenv` (Docker). VM evidence uses
`/sys/hypervisor/type`, narrow DMI product/vendor signatures for KVM/QEMU, VMware,
VirtualBox, Xen and the Microsoft/Virtual Machine pair for Hyper-V, then the exact
`hypervisor` CPU flag. `vmx`/`svm` are only capabilities. KVM refines QEMU; QEMU alone
does not rule out KVM acceleration. Xen includes control domains: `vm` does not
assert guest role or enumerate nesting. Container and VM may both be populated.
These hints are not a security guarantee; cloud/physical-looking DMI and missing
flags/markers cannot prove absence. No GPU or codec detection is performed.

Collection never initiates `su` or `sudo`, even when establishing
the shared SSH connection with elevation configured. A root SSH login can
legitimately report UID 0. Values describe the ordinary probe's visible
namespaces/rootfs, not necessarily the physical host or an elevated command.
Process architecture, pointer width and executable describe its non-login POSIX
`sh`, not the SSH account's login shell. CPU parallelism is a positive `nproc`
estimate, **not** a guarantee that every cgroup quota is accounted for.

Missing utilities, unreadable files, unsupported ELF ABIs and malformed values
become unknown; unknown UID also means `running_as_root:null`. Sources include
`uname` with selected `/proc` fallbacks, `id` with effective IDs from proc status,
and `os-release` parsed as data, never sourced/evaluated. `/usr/lib/os-release`
is used only when `/etc/os-release` is absent; their contents are never merged.

After server construction, one **3-second total bootstrap budget** covers SSH
connect/auth/retries, probe waits, execution and best-effort channel cleanup.
Signals cancel bootstrap before MCP serving. Ordinary tool connections retain their
existing timeout/retry policies. Raw stdout is capped at 64 KiB, stderr at 4 KiB; text scalars at 1 KiB,
release/status files at 16 KiB, executable paths at 4 KiB, and ELF at 64 bytes.
New CPU/virtualization sources use builtins without extra diagnostic utilities;
their records precede ELF so a missing `dd` does not hide the new information.
Completed fields survive later timeout/overflow. Metadata failures close only
the probe channel; closing it is not a guarantee of killing all descendants.
SSH/authentication failure or establishment timeout produces an unknown snapshot
instead of failing MCP startup. Normal tools can retry connecting afterwards.

The final instructions are frozen for the lifetime of the server process, including
partial/unknown values. Commands and SSH reconnect do not recollect or rewrite them.
A new process startup obtains a new snapshot. There is no refresh API, session
snapshot cache, TTL, polling or background collection. Library construction stays
lazy; programmatic consumers can use `with_startup_environment` before serving.

**Prompt/KV-cache friendly:** each run's prepared instructions, tool schemas and
order remain byte-stable through commands and SSH reconnect. Snapshot values are
labeled data and include no timestamps, elapsed time or cache-hit/session metadata.
The tradeoff is that this startup snapshot may become stale, or stay unknown after
an initial connection failure. A new process can produce different instructions;
provider cache hits and client serialization/history compaction remain outside the
server's control.

### Multi-file patches

Both patch tools accept `{ "patch": "..." }` with one or more file sections:

```text
*** Begin Patch
*** Add File: /tmp/new.txt
+hello
*** Update File: /tmp/existing.txt
@@
-before
+after
*** Delete File: /tmp/obsolete.txt
*** End Patch
```

There is **no fixed limit on the number of files or hunks**. Each source and
result file must be valid UTF-8 and at most **1 MiB**. Model output/context,
server memory (prepared content is held in memory), and client/SSH timeouts
remain practical limits. Use one section per absolute path; duplicate paths and
Move/rename are rejected. Parent directories must already exist.

The entire patch is parsed and all snapshots, plans, and size checks are completed
before any target writes. A preflight failure changes no target files. Commits
then run in patch order using the existing per-file SHA checks, locks, and staging.
A commit failure stops the remaining files; earlier commits are **not rolled back**.
Write permissions and filesystem conditions can still fail at commit time.

Single-file responses retain `{ok:true,path,operation}` or `{ok:false,error,message}`.
Multi-file successes return `{ok:true,files:[{path,operation,status},...]}`.
After parsing, multi-file errors also include `error`, `message`, the failing `path`,
and `phase` (`preflight` or `commit`). Per-file statuses are `applied`, `unchanged`
(a planned no-op), `failed`, `not_attempted`, or `unknown`. A preflight failure marks
the failing file `failed` and all others `not_attempted`; nothing was committed.
Syntax errors return the simple error response before file outcomes are available.
`unknown` means the remote commit acknowledgement was lost: inspect remote state
before retrying, and never blindly replay a partially applied batch. A client
timeout/cancellation without a response likewise does not prove that nothing changed.

OpenCode forwards this patch string without client-side changes. Restart/reconnect
the MCP server after installing the new binary to refresh its tool descriptions.

```

SeSSHion retains the established `ssh-mcp-rs` crate and `ssh-mcp` executable names for installation and configuration compatibility.

### Build from source

Requires the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) plus `pkg-config` and OpenSSL headers (`libssl-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0FL01/SeSSHion.git && cd SeSSHion
cargo build --release
```

## Adding to MCP clients

### OpenCode

Add to `opencode.jsonc` (SSH key recommended; password auth uses the `exec-raw` transfer transport):

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "ssh-remote": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": [
        "/absolute/path/to/ssh-mcp",
        "--host=example.com",
        "--port=22",
        "--user=alice",
        "--key=~/.ssh/id_ed25519"
      ],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

Use `SSH_MCP_PASSWORD` instead of `--key=...` for password authentication; prefer an MCP environment value over putting secrets in process arguments.
For `--key`, a leading `~/` is resolved through the local `HOME`; other tilde forms are left unchanged.

### SSH jump host

Configure one jump host with `--jump=USER@HOST[:PORT]` and exactly one independent jump credential. For example, this reaches `alice@127.0.0.1:2222` as seen from the jump host and uses a different key for each SSH login:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "ssh-private-host": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": [
        "/absolute/path/to/ssh-mcp",
        "--host=127.0.0.1",
        "--port=2222",
        "--user=alice",
        "--key=~/.ssh/target_key",
        "--jump=jump-user@example.com:2200",
        "--jump-key=~/.ssh/jump_key"
      ],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

`ssh-mcp` reads both private keys locally. It authenticates the jump first, opens an SSH `direct-tcpip` channel to the configured target, then performs a separate target SSH handshake inside that channel. Private key files are never uploaded to either host.

For password authentication, keep secrets out of the command arguments and pass them through the MCP environment. This example uses a jump password and a target key:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "ssh-private-host": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": [
        "/absolute/path/to/ssh-mcp",
        "--host=127.0.0.1",
        "--port=2222",
        "--user=alice",
        "--key=~/.ssh/target_key",
        "--jump=jump-user@example.com:2200"
      ],
      "environment": {
        "SSH_MCP_JUMP_PASSWORD": "{env:JUMP_SSH_PASSWORD}"
      },
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

Use `SSH_MCP_PASSWORD` for a target password and `SSH_MCP_JUMP_PASSWORD` for a jump password. Jump credentials never inherit target credentials. `--jump-password` is an SSH login password, not a private-key passphrase. Restart OpenCode after changing its configuration.

Transfer behavior through a jump host:

- `exec-raw` uses the persistent nested SSH session and supports key or password authentication on either hop.
- `rsync`, `sftp`, and `scp` require keys for both target and jump; `ssh-mcp` supplies the target key to the outer client and generates a jump ProxyCommand with the jump key.
- `auto` safely falls back to `exec-raw` when either hop uses a password. An explicitly requested unsupported local transport returns an error.
- Jump-backed local OpenSSH transports are currently Unix-only; `auto` still uses `exec-raw` on other platforms.

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code</b> — .mcp.json or ~/.claude.json</summary>

Add to your project's `.mcp.json` (shared via git) or to `~/.claude.json` under the top-level `mcpServers` key:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh-remote": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/ssh-mcp",
      "args": [
        "--host=example.com",
        "--port=22",
        "--user=alice",
        "--key=/path/to/private/key"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Strict production</b> — verified host key</summary>

Set `--strict-host-key-checking=yes` and point at a pre-populated `known_hosts` file (works in any client config):

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "ssh-remote": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": [
        "/absolute/path/to/ssh-mcp",
        "--host=example.com",
        "--user=alice",
        "--key=/home/alice/.ssh/id_ed25519",
        "--strict-host-key-checking=yes",
        "--known-hosts=/home/alice/.ssh/known_hosts"
      ],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Configuration

Every flag also has an `SSH_MCP_*` environment variable. Required: `--host`, `--user`, and either `--agent` or legacy credentials (`--password` and/or `--key`). In legacy mode, password takes precedence when both are configured.

| Argument | Env | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| `--host` | `SSH_MCP_HOST` | SSH host (required) |
| `--user` | `SSH_MCP_USER` | SSH username (required) |
| `--port` | `SSH_MCP_PORT` | SSH port (default: 22) |
| `--password` | `SSH_MCP_PASSWORD` | SSH password (alternative to key) |
| `--key` | `SSH_MCP_KEY` | Path to private key file (leading `~/` uses local `HOME`) |
| `--agent` | `SSH_MCP_AGENT` | Agent-only target authentication (Unix; `false` does not enable it) |
| `--agent-socket` | `SSH_MCP_AGENT_SOCKET` | Target socket override; otherwise snapshot `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` at startup |
| `--agent-identity` | `SSH_MCP_AGENT_IDENTITY` | OpenSSH public-key selector, never a private-key file |
| `--auth-timeout-ms` | `SSH_MCP_AUTH_TIMEOUT_MS` | Entire authentication budget per endpoint, 1–600000 ms; agent default 90000 |
| `--jump` | `SSH_MCP_JUMP` | One jump host as `USER@HOST[:PORT]` |
| `--jump-key` | `SSH_MCP_JUMP_KEY` | Jump private key path (leading `~/` uses local `HOME`) |
| `--jump-password` | `SSH_MCP_JUMP_PASSWORD` | Jump SSH login password (alternative to jump key) |
| `--jump-agent` | `SSH_MCP_JUMP_AGENT` | Agent-only jump authentication, independent of the target |
| `--jump-agent-socket` | `SSH_MCP_JUMP_AGENT_SOCKET` | Jump socket override; otherwise snapshot `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` |
| `--jump-agent-identity` | `SSH_MCP_JUMP_AGENT_IDENTITY` | Independent jump public-key selector |
| `--spool-dir` | `SSH_MCP_SPOOL_DIR` | Absolute local directory for background job logs and state |
| `--sudo-password` | `SSH_MCP_SUDO_PASSWORD` | Password for `sudo` commands |
| `--timeout` | `SSH_MCP_TIMEOUT` | Command timeout in ms (default: 300000) |
| `--max-output-tokens` | `SSH_MCP_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | Shell output token limit (default: 16000 ≈ 64KB; `none` to disable) |
| `--disable-sudo` | `SSH_MCP_DISABLE_SUDO` | Disable the `sudo_shell` and `sudo_apply_patch` tools |

Run `ssh-mcp --help` for the full list (logging, keepalive, reconnect, host-key options).

The explicit spool path must be absolute. Without it, Unix uses `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ssh-mcp` when `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is absolute, then falls back to `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/ssh-mcp-$EUID`. Windows uses `%TEMP%\ssh-mcp`. On Unix, the spool directory must be owned by the server user and is kept at mode `0700`.

### SSH host key verification

`ssh-mcp` verifies the server host key before authentication to prevent silent man-in-the-middle replacement:

- `accept-new` (default): trust and record an unknown key on first connection; reject later changes.
- `yes`: require the key to already exist in `known_hosts`; reject unknown or changed keys.
- `no`: disable verification; only for disposable test environments.

With a jump host, the same policy and `known_hosts` file are applied independently to jump and target host/port identities. `accept-new` records unknown keys but rejects changed keys.

### SSH-agent authentication

On macOS and Linux, `--agent` uses an existing local agent to sign SSH authentication requests. It supports Ed25519, ECDSA P-256/P-384, and RSA SHA-2 identities, including keys loaded through a user-managed PKCS#11 workflow. SeSSHion never exports a private key or collects a PIN/passphrase. Configure the PIV identity using [Yubico's SSH guide](https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/Guides/SSH_with_PIV_and_PKCS11.html) and confirm it appears in `ssh-add -L`.

```bash
ssh-mcp \
  --host devbox.example.com --user developer \
  --agent --agent-identity "$HOME/.ssh/yubikey-piv.pub" \
  --auth-timeout-ms 90000 \
  --strict-host-key-checking yes --known-hosts "$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts" \
  --spool-dir "$HOME/.cache/sesshion/codex"
```

Use a host key verified through a trusted channel in `known_hosts`; strict mode verifies it before contacting the agent. Each endpoint chooses its explicit socket override first, then the startup value of `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`. Leading `~/` expands through local `HOME`. The socket need not exist at startup; a later tool call can recover after the configured agent starts. A changed socket pathname requires relaunching the MCP process.

Agent mode is explicit and conflicts with that endpoint's password/private-key options, including environment credentials. Remove stale `SSH_MCP_PASSWORD` / `SSH_MCP_KEY` values when enabling it. Socket/selector flags require their corresponding agent mode; jump options also require `--jump`. Jump credentials never inherit target settings: combine `--jump user@bastion --jump-agent --jump-agent-identity /path/jump.pub` with any supported target mode.

Selectors contain exactly one OpenSSH public key, optionally with blank/comment lines, and are limited to 16 KiB. Matching uses public-key data, ignoring comments and enumeration order. Without a selector, exactly one eligible plain public key must be loaded. Certificates are excluded from selection and counting; certificate selectors and destination-constrained keys are unsupported. No failed agent attempt falls back to another key, password, or disk key.

The 90-second agent budget covers socket connection, identities, unsigned probes, signing, and the server reply. Jump and target each receive their own budget. An explicit `--auth-timeout-ms` also sets an entire endpoint budget for legacy modes; without it, their existing 20-second per-request behavior remains. Authentication failure is terminal for an agent attempt, and at most one signature is requested per endpoint attempt. A later explicit tool call starts fresh; transient transport failures retain bounded reconnect retries.

The CLI's startup snapshot can request agent signing before the first tool call.
Its 3-second total bootstrap deadline takes precedence over endpoint budgets,
including on jump/proxy routes. If hardware interaction cannot finish in time,
startup continues with unknown metadata; a later tool call can authenticate with
the normal endpoint budget. A successful startup connection is reused by tools
without another signature. Library construction remains lazy unless the caller
uses `with_startup_environment`.

When either endpoint uses an agent, `auto` chooses `exec-raw` directly. File/directory uploads and downloads, foreground/background jobs, overwrite checks, and cancellation use the authenticated route. Explicit `sftp`, `scp`, and `rsync` requests fail before destination mutation.

This provides authentication only. The local socket is never forwarded to the remote host. Connection reuse is SeSSHion's own persistent connection, independent of OpenSSH `ControlMaster`. Removing the token does not revoke an already authenticated session. Background-job durability remains as described below.

### Client setup for Herdr

Launch one stdio MCP process per local client from Herdr's environment, with `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` available to each child. Give Codex, oh-my-pi, Grok, and Amp distinct absolute spool directories and separate remote worktrees. Keep ephemeral socket paths out of shared configuration; pass the environment value at launch. These examples use `/Users/alice` as a placeholder for an absolute local home path.

The following client examples are **protocol-compatible only**: their settings were checked against the linked client documentation, but interactive client sessions and physical hardware were not exercised. The actual SeSSHion stdio workflow is exercised by the four-process integration test. CLI startup includes the bounded 3-second environment probe described above. Client per-tool deadlines must still accommodate endpoint authentication budgets plus command work when startup did not establish a route; a route with two agent endpoints can need more than 180 seconds.

**Codex** — `~/.codex/config.toml` ([configuration reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference)):

```toml
[mcp_servers.sesshion]
command = "/absolute/path/to/ssh-mcp"
args = ["--host", "devbox.example.com", "--user", "developer", "--agent",
        "--agent-identity", "/Users/alice/.ssh/yubikey-piv.pub",
        "--strict-host-key-checking", "yes",
        "--spool-dir", "/Users/alice/.cache/sesshion/codex"]
env_vars = ["SSH_AUTH_SOCK"]
tool_timeout_sec = 120
```

Codex's default per-tool timeout is 60 seconds, below the single-endpoint agent default. Raise `tool_timeout_sec` further for two hops or longer foreground commands.

**oh-my-pi** — `~/.omp/agent/mcp.json` ([MCP configuration](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/blob/HEAD/docs/mcp-config.md)):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sesshion": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/ssh-mcp",
      "args": ["--host", "devbox.example.com", "--user", "developer", "--agent",
               "--agent-identity", "/Users/alice/.ssh/yubikey-piv.pub",
               "--strict-host-key-checking", "yes",
               "--spool-dir", "/Users/alice/.cache/sesshion/omp"],
      "env": {"SSH_AUTH_SOCK": "${SSH_AUTH_SOCK}"},
      "timeout": 120000
    }
  }
}
```

OMP's `OMP_MCP_TIMEOUT_MS` overrides the per-server timeout; ensure it is unset or sufficiently large.

**Grok CLI** — `~/.grok/config.toml` ([MCP configuration](https://docs.x.ai/build/features/mcp-servers)):

```toml
[mcp_servers.sesshion]
command = "/absolute/path/to/ssh-mcp"
args = ["--host", "devbox.example.com", "--user", "developer", "--agent",
        "--agent-identity", "/Users/alice/.ssh/yubikey-piv.pub",
        "--strict-host-key-checking", "yes",
        "--spool-dir", "/Users/alice/.cache/sesshion/grok"]
env = { SSH_AUTH_SOCK = "${SSH_AUTH_SOCK}" }
tool_timeout_sec = 120
```

**Amp** — `~/.config/amp/settings.json` ([MCP configuration](https://ampcode.com/docs/customize/mcp)):

```json
{
  "amp.mcpServers": {
    "sesshion": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/ssh-mcp",
      "args": ["--host", "devbox.example.com", "--user", "developer", "--agent",
               "--agent-identity", "/Users/alice/.ssh/yubikey-piv.pub",
               "--strict-host-key-checking", "yes",
               "--spool-dir", "/Users/alice/.cache/sesshion/amp"],
      "env": {"SSH_AUTH_SOCK": "${SSH_AUTH_SOCK}"}
    }
  }
}
```

Amp's documented server schema does not specify a per-tool deadline override. Start initial authentication with `shell` using `background=true`, then poll `check_process`; background handoff returns before SSH authentication. Use this also when a client's foreground deadline is shorter than a two-hop budget. A readiness/startup setting is not an authentication timeout.

### Agent troubleshooting and hardware verification

| Failure | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Socket not reachable | Check the explicit override and `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` inheritance; start the configured agent. Relaunch SeSSHion if its socket pathname changed. |
| No usable identities | Inspect `ssh-add -L`; load the intended PIV key through your existing `ssh-add -s <pkcs11-library>` workflow. Certificate-only agents are unsupported. |
| Multiple identities / selector not loaded | Set the correct `.pub` selector for that endpoint and compare its fingerprint with the loaded plain keys. |
| Server did not accept identity; no signature requested | Check the remote user's authorized public key and accepted algorithms. Agent RSA never uses SHA-1. |
| Agent refused to sign | Inspect the agent/hardware workflow. A generic refusal does not distinguish PIN, touch, removal, or destination constraints. Constrained keys require session binding that this release does not provide; retain their constraints. |
| Server rejected signature | Check remote authorization and server diagnostics; the attempt stops after that signature. |
| Authentication timeout / agent connection lost | Check agent availability and local client deadlines, then make a fresh explicit attempt. |
| Unsupported platform | Agent authentication requires macOS/Linux Unix-domain sockets. |

Automated coverage uses disposable software identities and agents. The physical YubiKey checklist remains **not run** until a user-managed token and host are available:

```bash
SSH_MCP_YUBIKEY_TEST=1 \
SSH_MCP_YUBIKEY_PUB=/absolute/path/yubikey-piv.pub \
SSH_MCP_YUBIKEY_HOST=developer@devbox.example.com \
cargo test --test yubikey_smoke -- --ignored --nocapture
```

The ignored smoke uses strict `~/.ssh/known_hosts` and verifies a command plus fresh reconnect. Separately record PIN/touch policy, delayed touch beyond the budget, refusal, removal/reinsertion, and simultaneous initial/reconnections from all four clients. Exercise commands, patches, background status, and `exec-raw` transfers in each client. Never script wrong-PIN attempts; a PIV PIN can have only three retries.

## Long-running jobs

Start potentially long commands or transfers with `background=true`. MCP does not expose the client's deadline to the server, so the client may stop waiting earlier even when the server-side timeout is longer. Background mode returns a `job_id` before SSH connection or transfer preflight. Poll it with `check_process`:

```json
{"job_id": "abc123", "tail_lines": 50}
```

Treat job IDs as opaque and use the originating MCP instance to query them. IDs distinguish concurrent local server processes even when jobs start in the same millisecond.

For a scheduled one-shot observation, set a local wait in seconds:

```json
{"job_id": "abc123", "wait_for": 600, "tail_lines": 10}
```

Command jobs return PID, command, log path/tail, and exit state. Transfer jobs return `job_type="transfer"`, coarse phase, elapsed time, current transport, reliable file staging bytes when available, and the compact transfer result at completion. Transfer jobs are in-memory only. Their `timeout_ms` is one whole-operation deadline including connection, preflight, and safe fallback; cleanup gets a short separate grace period.

`check_process` first validates and snapshots the job. Errors and terminal states return immediately. A running job waits locally for the full `wait_for` interval without polling, then returns one fresh snapshot; completion during the interval does not wake the call early.

Cancelling `check_process` stops only its passive local wait. Cancelling the request that created a background job after handoff does not stop that job. Foreground transfer cancellation stops its owned writer and prevents commit; call `check_process` again for authoritative background state.

On SIGINT or SIGTERM, the server cancels the MCP service and performs its bounded request drain before closing SSH. Shutdown prevents new SSH connections and reconnects, but closing the session may terminate channel-bound remote commands; no explicit remote kill or survival guarantee is made.

For command jobs, the returned state is one of `running`, `completed`, `failed`, or `state_lost`, plus the log tail. `completed` and `failed` include an `exit_code`; `state_lost` means the server no longer has a trustworthy terminal outcome.

Transfer destinations have one active in-process writer. Staging names are collision-resistant and exclusively created; overwrite commits use sibling staging, and directory replacement rolls back the old destination if installation fails. Directory `overwrite=false` intentionally remains non-atomic.

Background tracking requires the MCP server and its SSH session to remain alive; transfer jobs do not survive server restart and do not automatically resume.

## Safety

- **Stdio transport.** JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout — no exposed network ports.
- **Credentials in memory only.** Passwords and keys are never logged.
- **Logs to stderr.** Internal logging stays off the MCP protocol channel.
- **Path validation.** Rejects control characters, traversal (`..`), and shell-injection shapes.
- **Binary protection.** Patch tools reject non-UTF-8 content to prevent corruption.
- **Per-file atomic edits.** Staging with automatic cleanup and conflict detection; multi-file batches have no rollback.
- **Explicit elevation.** `apply_patch` never retries under sudo; privileged edits require an explicit `sudo_apply_patch` call.
